SMU education is known for its highly interactive, collaborative and project-based approach to learning, and for its technologically enabled pedagogy of seminar-style teaching in small class sizes.
The School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) offers an exceptionally supportive and inspirational environment for academic scholarship and research, applied R&D projects, and innovative education initiatives. We currently have over 40 tenure-track faculty members working across research areas in computer science & engineering, and information systems management. They are complemented by over 20 practice & education faculty members who focus on teaching, translation and pedagogical research.

At the same time, our faculty actively publish in top-quality Computer Science and Management Science conferences and journals. On our faculty are several world-class scholars and rising stars in their respective disciplines.
We are committed to supporting the development of our faculty.
