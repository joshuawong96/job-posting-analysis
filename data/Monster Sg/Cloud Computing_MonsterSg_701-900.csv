Data platform PO component
The platform team is responsible for the setup, creation and operation of infrastructure and tooling used by data engineers, data scientists and data analysts across the organisation. As the organisation grows, we require more sophisticated and standardised tooling to manage problems associated with scale. Such problems span governance problems including data discoverability, quality, lineage, privacy as well as generally providing greater developer experience and productivity to enable us to build a more data and AI driven product. In this respect we need a data product owner to help engage with the customers of the data platform team, i.e. the data engineers, scientists and analysts using the tooling, to help shape the platform. This will involve helping build both developer tools and UI based tools, but the focus will be more on developer experience than UI.
Requirements in this respect include:
PO experience working on designing both front end and importantly complex back-end systems

Experience designing products to run on cloud computing platforms like GCP or AWS
Being able to monitor and anticipate technology trends
Being able to build relationships with all the key users / stakeholders of the data platform to ensure there is ongoing customer listening, both to determine new needs and assess where existing product is not meeting their needs
Being able to define, measure, and continuously evaluate the measure of success for the platform
Chapter lead component
The data solutions teams are responsible for working with the different areas of the business (internally called tribes), to help solve problems using data. Examples of tribes and associated data solutions teams include marketing, operations, credit risk, fraud & AML, finance, and a number of teams for digital platform which is the area responsible for building the core digital banking products. The teams right now consist of a mix of data engineers and data scientists, with a data product owner per team. The responsibilities of the data product chapter lead in this respect will be to help provide oversight and mentorship across the data product owners to ensure:
Standardardization of ways of working
Best practices are established
Knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Data POs have the support they need to do their jobs, particularly as it relates to stakeholder management
Helping the POs from the different teams set and measure OKRs
Defining key metrics / indicators to measure progress and success of the Products. Designing dashboards to track these.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Help us build open-source tools and technologies that do for legal and qualitative reasoning what the spreadsheet has done for quantitative reasoning.
At SMU's research programme in Computational Law, researchers develop open-source languages and libraries to be shared on Github and used by a future generation of web and mobile apps. We have three to five years to accomplish this goal.
As a member of the team, you will have the opportunity to participate in software projects. This involves:

Writing user-facing applications throughout the full stack
Success metrics:You can measure your (external) success in this job by the number and quality of contributions accepted into the research programme's Github repositories. Numerous software development assignments will be available. You can measure (internal) success by how frequently you find yourself in a flow state; by how many new ways of thinking you have mastered; and by how well you can get computers to help you and other people achieve important goals.
QUALIFICATIONS
Self-taught programmers and holders of non-CS qualifications are welcome to apply.
The following qualifications are an advantage:
