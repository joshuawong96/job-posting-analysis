We're based out of the fresh new WeWork Funan with all the perks, and we provide flexible arrangements. We're just as excited about tech as we are design so we have some excellent systems in place for working remotely but remaining collaborative.
With a roster of world-leading tech clients, we place significant importance on technology and R&D. We dedicate around 20% of our time looking towards future-leading technologies and new projects, and to date, we've developed a series of proprietary platforms such as cloud rendering tech that allows us to deliver uniquely personalised videos to thousands of recipients, or realtime projection rendering technology to create immersive environments and experiences.
We also want you to feel good about the impact of your job on your local and global community. We provide paid volunteering time, matched donations to registered charities, and initiatives like the use of 100% renewable energy and recycling programs in our offices. We carbon offset our travel, and we give back with pro-bono work for selected non-profit organisations.
The role
We're on the lookout for someone with the ultimate balance of organisation and agility, to work with our Leadership and Producer teams to allocate our designers on some challenging and exciting digital marketing, graphic design, virtual/in-person events, and video production projects.

This is a role for a detail-oriented traffic manager with resource management experience

You'll be mostly working with briefs, timelines, and client docs in Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Slides, Meet) and with our resourcing software, Streamtime.
In our team of close to 50, you'll report to our Operations Manager, and work in collaboration with our Producer team to ensure that our projects have the necessary designers with the right skills to deliver our projects.
A creative approach
You'll join our new operations team across our Melbourne and Singapore offices who have a keen focus on our people and our processes. You'll work with our Client Leads, Producers and Design Team Leads who will give you an understanding of the project requirements and our team's abilities. You'll keep an eye on our project pipeline and identify when we need to utilise additional freelance resources and you'll put the pieces into place so that our projects kick off smoothly.

Our traffic manager is the gateway between Evolved and a world full of talented freelancers. From graphic and motion design to editing, to creative directors and video producers, you'll be searching for great people with amazing skills to add to our pool whilst maintaining our strong relationships with all our wonderful freelancers.

You'll be cool, calm and collected, adapt to the ever-changing project landscape - your project solving will give the producers and designers the confidence they need to focus on their projects.
Dr Who
Our Traffic Manager is a time lord, you won't be flying through space and time in your TARDIS to defeat the Daleks but you will be across timelines, budgets, milestones, and daily project tasks to understand the needs of projects and flex and problem solve as those needs change.
Culture
We're a tight knit team of passionate people from different backgrounds, upbringings and walks of life. We take an inclusive approach not only to our internal team but also to our design practices - making sure that we are challenging our clients to be inclusive and to be representative of a wide population.

It should go without saying, but we're an equal opportunity employer. Our differences are what make us a great team!
We'd love to hear from you

Senior Solutions Architect,Amazon,Not Specified,Permanent Job,8-11 Years,,"Job Description :
Role is based in Singapore, covering APJ with some regional responsibilities. This role specifically is to work with the Venture Capitalists, Incubators and Accelerators across APJ.

Do you like startups Are you interested in cloud computing Yes We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo. To address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that's capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We're here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible - and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you'll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You'll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you'll also get plenty of time to sharpen the saw and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it's important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You'll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don't get to work with on a 1:1 basis you'll get the chance to share your knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon's culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn't about how many hours you spend at home or at work it's about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we're building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

SMU education is known for its highly interactive, collaborative and project-based approach to learning, and for its technologically enabled pedagogy of seminar-style teaching in small class sizes.

At the same time, our faculty actively publish in top-quality Computer Science and Management Science conferences and journals. On our faculty are several world-class scholars and rising stars in their respective disciplines.
We are committed to supporting the development of our faculty.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference
Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
About the Role:
Our Senior Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces to name a few.
Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the why behind what you are doing.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by the way things have always been done. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
We also hope you'll take some time to learn more about The Trade Desk and what it's like to work here. Here are a few links to help get you started:
Learn more about our mission to transform the global advertising industry
See what it's like to be an engineer on one of the world's most highly scaled Internet applications
Experience a taste of our global culture
Get to know a few members of our team
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what's important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
