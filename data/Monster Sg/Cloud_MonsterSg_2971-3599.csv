We've recently raised US$2,250,000 in seed funding and we're now looking to scale up rapidly in line with our traction.
Cyber security veterans and technical experts, we are obsessed with building exciting technology for some of the world's most targeted organisations. By leveraging data, our aim is to empower organisations to keep up with the rapid rate of evolution across the cyber security industry, by providing continuous and real-time assurance in line with a frontline adversarial understanding of cyber security.
We are a young, high-energy and high-performing team that is devoted to building world-class technology in pursuit of realising our mission. We are in a high and aggressive growth phase of our journey, and are excited to continue adding colleagues to join our phorce of nature.
But what's the role
We are looking for offensive security experts to expand our watchTowr LABS team, and work with us to evolve our Continuous Attack Surface Testing technology. watchTowr LABS is our epicentre of offensive security expertise, and has been designed to operate like an APT group.
This is not consultancy work, project-based work, or engagements restricted by scope/time/budget. Enterprises rely on our technology and approach to look at their organisations holistically, and continuously, as if they were being continuously red team'd.
If something is exposed to the Internet - whether it's SaaS, cloud, shadow IT, or the random marketing website everyone forgot about presents a weakness to their organisation - it's our job to discover it, highlight it, and track it.
This is the opportunity to use your expertise to continuously find ways to break into some of the world and region's largest brands, enterprises and businesses.
Our vision for offensive security is continuous.
Sounds great what will I do
You will spend your days looking for vulnerabilities in numerous organisations - no scope, no time restrictions, no limitations.
You will be focused on looking for the vulnerabilities that matter - high-impact weaknesses that would have a material impact on our clients. We don't care about SSL ciphers, we care about Remote Code Execution.
You'll work with other offensive security experts to share ideas and brainstorm new tactics and techniques that we can use to demonstrate high-impact weaknesses in organisations.
You'll be performing cutting-edge offensive security research to build and test your own high-impact tactics and techniques. Our research has one goal - strengthen external attack surfaces.
Your tactics and techniques will be deployed at scale to all of our clients, and implemented into our technology - our message is very clear, never do anything twice, let our technology provide the harness and continuous framework you need.
You will be analysing the technical details of emerging weaknesses, and rapidly building proof-of-concepts to identify vulnerable assets (we helped our clients react to Log4J in 2 hours!).
If your dream is to speak at conferences and present your research to the world - we will support you to make it happen!
Ideal Experience
Ideally, you should have 3 or more years of experience, with:
Involvement in red-team exercises with large enterprises.
Have rockstar offensive security skills across the infrastructure, application and cloud domains.
Have basic scripting skills in GoLang and/or Python.
Hold industry-recognised qualifications, like CCSAS/CCT/CRT/OSCP.
Bonus Experience
It'll also be awesome if you have:
Lead red-team and adversarial simulation exercises.
Performed cyber-security simulations with actions across the kill-chain.
Have published your own research, whether it be in blogposts or at conferences.
Have demonstrated your skills across bug-bounty programmes.
Our Experience
When you join us, you can expect (ok, we kinda expect this from you too):
A highly motivated, experienced, offensive cyber team that obsesses over our shared mission.
To be part of a team of outcome-focused problem-solvers.
An environment of autonomy and creativity to support you to deliver the best work of your life.
Finding vulnerabilities and breaking technologies in various cool and creative ways.
A culture of continuous improvement in the form of learning and growth.
What's in it for me
Competitive compensation - we believe that hard work, skills and ambition should be fairly compensated.
Meaningful role in a company - You will be a key and early contributor to a fast-growing cyber security business that helps protect some of the world's largest enterprises.
The best tools and powerful kit - we enable you with the tools to effectively fulfil your role.
Endless opportunities we are in a high-growth phase of our journey, and plan to promote from within as we scale.
Work with cyber security experts we are solving cutting-edge industry-wide cyber security challenges with some of the world's most advanced organisations.
Work hard, play hard - we work hard together, but we also have fun together. On Fridays, we regularly turn on the speakers, open the beer fridge, and prepare for the weekend.

A day in the life
Senior Solution Architects (SA) collaborate with Global Account Managers (GAM), Customer Solutions Managers (CSM), Business Development Managers (BD), and other SAs to discover, qualify and deliver complex customer engagements aimed at removing blockers to their cloud journey usually delivered in take the form of a prototype or a deployment workshop.

For prototyping engagements, you will lead workshops with senior customer stakeholders to elicit and prioritize functional and non-functional requirements and mapping them into an agreed scope. During the engagement you work with other SAs and customer technical staff to iteratively deliver the agreed outcome over a series of sprints. At engagement conclusion, you facilitate handover and knowledge transfer sessions to the customer, partner or chosen integrator's team to setup them up for a successful path to production.

Deployment workshops are multi-day high impact events bringing together cross-functional teams and expertise from both AWS and the customer. During these events you show how and guide our customers to achieve workstream specific goals.

Outside of engagements you will be establishing relationships with your counterpart SAs in the region to get to know their business and source future engagements in alignment with the account strategy. In addition, you will be taking artifacts created during engagements and packaging them as re-usable assets for in and external consumption. This can take many forms including published solutions and code artifacts, whitepapers and blogs, or podcasts and presentations at public AWS events such as regional summits and re:Invent.

No two customer engagement or constraints are the same and you will have the opportunity to learn and work with a variety of technology domains, programming languages, and frameworks and you will be given the time and space needed to grow into them.

About Nalagenetics
Nalagenetics is a venture backed Singaporean company aiming to increase efficacy of prescription and reduce adverse drug reactions using genetic testing and information management systems.

The Data Product Owner Chapter Lead role is a fairly unique role encompassing both a handson product owner role for the data platform as well as a management role overseeing the other data product owners working on data products for different areas of the business.
The data organisation (chapter) is primarily partitioned into a platform team and a collection of data solutions teams.
Data platform PO component
The platform team is responsible for the setup, creation and operation of infrastructure and tooling used by data engineers, data scientists and data analysts across the organisation. As the organisation grows, we require more sophisticated and standardised tooling to manage problems associated with scale. Such problems span governance problems including data discoverability, quality, lineage, privacy as well as generally providing greater developer experience and productivity to enable us to build a more data and AI driven product. In this respect we need a data product owner to help engage with the customers of the data platform team, i.e. the data engineers, scientists and analysts using the tooling, to help shape the platform. This will involve helping build both developer tools and UI based tools, but the focus will be more on developer experience than UI.
Requirements in this respect include:
PO experience working on designing both front end and importantly complex back-end systems
Experience with scrum and associated tools commonly used with it (e.g. Jira)
Good design skills when it comes to producing architectural diagrams, wireframes, sequence diagrams and other design artefacts.
Experience working on products where data engineers, analysts, and scientists are the end users
Experience in being a developer evangelist - continuously communicate benefits of the tools and platforms, create content or materials for purpose of adoption, and conducting workshops
Basic knowledge about batch and stream data processing, data warehousing, data architecture and data governance. Knowledge about technologies such as Kafka, Spark/Flink/Dataflow, Airflow, BigQuery/Redshift/Snowflake, Kubernetes, etc.
Experience designing products to run on cloud computing platforms like GCP or AWS
Being able to monitor and anticipate technology trends
Being able to build relationships with all the key users / stakeholders of the data platform to ensure there is ongoing customer listening, both to determine new needs and assess where existing product is not meeting their needs
Being able to define, measure, and continuously evaluate the measure of success for the platform
Chapter lead component
The data solutions teams are responsible for working with the different areas of the business (internally called tribes), to help solve problems using data. Examples of tribes and associated data solutions teams include marketing, operations, credit risk, fraud & AML, finance, and a number of teams for digital platform which is the area responsible for building the core digital banking products. The teams right now consist of a mix of data engineers and data scientists, with a data product owner per team. The responsibilities of the data product chapter lead in this respect will be to help provide oversight and mentorship across the data product owners to ensure:
Standardardization of ways of working
Best practices are established
Knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Data POs have the support they need to do their jobs, particularly as it relates to stakeholder management
Helping the POs from the different teams set and measure OKRs
Defining key metrics / indicators to measure progress and success of the Products. Designing dashboards to track these.
