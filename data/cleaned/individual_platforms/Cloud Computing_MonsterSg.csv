SMU education is known for its highly interactive, collaborative and project-based approach to learning, and for its technologically enabled pedagogy of seminar-style teaching in small class sizes.

At the same time, our faculty actively publish in top-quality Computer Science and Management Science conferences and journals. On our faculty are several world-class scholars and rising stars in their respective disciplines.
We are committed to supporting the development of our faculty.

Senior Solutions Architect,Amazon,,permanent,"['8', '11']",,"Job Description :
Role is based in Singapore, covering APJ with some regional responsibilities. This role specifically is to work with the Venture Capitalists, Incubators and Accelerators across APJ.

Do you like startups Are you interested in cloud computing Yes We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo. To address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that's capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We're here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible - and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you'll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You'll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you'll also get plenty of time to sharpen the saw and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it's important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You'll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don't get to work with on a 1:1 basis you'll get the chance to share your knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences.

Work/Life Balance

We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we're building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

Do you like startups Are you interested in cloud computing Yes We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo. To address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that's capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We're here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible - and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you'll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You'll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you'll also get plenty of time to sharpen the saw and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it's important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You'll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don't get to work with on a 1:1 basis you'll get the chance to share your knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

Singapore Management University is a place where high-level professionalism blends together with a healthy informality. The family-like atmosphere among the SMU community fosters a culture where employees work, plan, organise and play together building a strong collegiality and morale within the university.

Our commitment to attract and retain talent is ongoing. We offer attractive benefits and welfare, competitive compensation packages, and generous professional development opportunities all to meet the work-life needs of our staff. No wonder, then, that SMU continues to be given numerous awards and recognition for its human resource excellence.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Help us build open-source tools and technologies that do for legal and qualitative reasoning what the spreadsheet has done for quantitative reasoning.
At SMU's research programme in Computational Law, researchers develop open-source languages and libraries to be shared on Github and used by a future generation of web and mobile apps. We have three to five years to accomplish this goal.
As a member of the team, you will have the opportunity to participate in software projects. This involves:

Writing user-facing applications throughout the full stack
Success metrics:You can measure your (external) success in this job by the number and quality of contributions accepted into the research programme's Github repositories. Numerous software development assignments will be available. You can measure (internal) success by how frequently you find yourself in a flow state; by how many new ways of thinking you have mastered; and by how well you can get computers to help you and other people achieve important goals.
QUALIFICATIONS

The following qualifications are an advantage:
You regularly program in at least one programming language. Programming languages include Javascript, Python, Ruby, Clojure, Reason, Scala, Scheme, Common Lisp, Haskell, Ocaml, Elm, and Prolog.
You have developed at least one piece of software that somebody else has used.
You are comfortable using the Unix shell or Windows Terminal with WSL.
You are able to independently learn technology from books and online courses (though you will be supported when you get stuck if you ask questions the smart way, as Eric Raymond and Eric Moen put it.)
You have previously asked, or answered, a question on a technical community support forum.
You have an account on Github or Gitlab.
Other people turn to you for help with technology, and I mean people besides family.
You possess the 5 Personality Traits Every New Programmer Should Have, according to learntocodewith.me: Patience, Courage, Passion, Creativity, Logic.
You also possess the Three Great Virtues of a Programmer, according to threevirtues.com: Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris.
Learning opportunities
During your time with us, you will be exposed to areas of computing that lie beyond web/mobile app development, data science, and machine learning. You will learn to see the world as a computer scientist does in terms of logics, languages, and libraries and acquire, on the job, many of the skills on Matt Might's list of what every computer science major should know.

The Data Product Owner Chapter Lead role is a fairly unique role encompassing both a handson product owner role for the data platform as well as a management role overseeing the other data product owners working on data products for different areas of the business.
The data organisation (chapter) is primarily partitioned into a platform team and a collection of data solutions teams.
Data platform PO component
The platform team is responsible for the setup, creation and operation of infrastructure and tooling used by data engineers, data scientists and data analysts across the organisation. As the organisation grows, we require more sophisticated and standardised tooling to manage problems associated with scale. Such problems span governance problems including data discoverability, quality, lineage, privacy as well as generally providing greater developer experience and productivity to enable us to build a more data and AI driven product. In this respect we need a data product owner to help engage with the customers of the data platform team, i.e. the data engineers, scientists and analysts using the tooling, to help shape the platform. This will involve helping build both developer tools and UI based tools, but the focus will be more on developer experience than UI.
Requirements in this respect include:
PO experience working on designing both front end and importantly complex back-end systems
Experience with scrum and associated tools commonly used with it (e.g. Jira)
Good design skills when it comes to producing architectural diagrams, wireframes, sequence diagrams and other design artefacts.
Experience working on products where data engineers, analysts, and scientists are the end users
Experience in being a developer evangelist - continuously communicate benefits of the tools and platforms, create content or materials for purpose of adoption, and conducting workshops
Basic knowledge about batch and stream data processing, data warehousing, data architecture and data governance. Knowledge about technologies such as Kafka, Spark/Flink/Dataflow, Airflow, BigQuery/Redshift/Snowflake, Kubernetes, etc.
Experience designing products to run on cloud computing platforms like GCP or AWS
Being able to monitor and anticipate technology trends
Being able to build relationships with all the key users / stakeholders of the data platform to ensure there is ongoing customer listening, both to determine new needs and assess where existing product is not meeting their needs
Being able to define, measure, and continuously evaluate the measure of success for the platform
Chapter lead component
The data solutions teams are responsible for working with the different areas of the business (internally called tribes), to help solve problems using data. Examples of tribes and associated data solutions teams include marketing, operations, credit risk, fraud & AML, finance, and a number of teams for digital platform which is the area responsible for building the core digital banking products. The teams right now consist of a mix of data engineers and data scientists, with a data product owner per team. The responsibilities of the data product chapter lead in this respect will be to help provide oversight and mentorship across the data product owners to ensure:
Standardardization of ways of working
Best practices are established
Knowledge sharing and continuous learning
Data POs have the support they need to do their jobs, particularly as it relates to stakeholder management
Helping the POs from the different teams set and measure OKRs
Defining key metrics / indicators to measure progress and success of the Products. Designing dashboards to track these.
In this respect prior experience managing product owners is required.",['Other'],"['IT', 'Banking']","['Product Manager - Auto/Home/Personal Loan', 'Other Software/Hardware/EDP']",2022-03-17,https://www.monster.com.sg/seeker/job-details?id=5472809&searchId=89523e9b-a41c-4c28-ae41-fa370f6a9ac4
