Key Activities

Modern manufacturing is no longer just about finding ways to operate faster while reducing expenses; it is also about doing so in a data-driven and intelligent way. With technologies such as cloud and data analytics, the vast quantities of data generated can be processed and translated into actionable insights to diagnose problems and identify opportunities for improvement. With machine learning, highly intelligent systems can assist the workforce in optimising processes, predicting equipment failures and changes in demand patterns. At their best, these intelligent systems can also autonomously make decisions and respond to changing internal and external business needs.

An opportunity exists to enhance performance monitoring through development of interactive digital dashboards to trend key performance indicators (KPIs). Performance dashboards are used extensively during Tier review meetings; data displayed focuses on high level KPI’s for Tier 4 meetings, with associated drill-down data relevant to specific functions required at the lower level Tiers. It is therefore critical that dashboards offer a high level of connectivity and adaptability to enable their use across the tier meeting requirements.

 Job Category Customer Success Group Job Details 

The Enterprise Architect (also known as Program Architect) is an instrumental service at Salesforce Industries, partnering with our leading customers to fully maximise their investment in the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product and implement the platform as it was designed. This ensures our customers deploy a solution that is fast to market, highly performant and scalable, and allows them to realize the overall business objectives of their digital transformation program.

Built In Partnership With Salesforce, It Is 100% Native And Additive To The Salesforce Platform With 3 Fundamental Layers

Salesforce Industries serves the world’s largest companies with the most complete and innovative suite of industry-focused, customer-centric & omni-channel solutions.
 An extensive industry-specific data model.  A complete set of industry-specific business processes and integrations.  A full range of industry-specific omni-channel experiences and apps (including sales, marketing, service, enterprise product catalog, CPQ, contract management, order management and commerce solutions). 
Salesforce Industries has invested over $100m in R&D to extend Salesforce and deliver these industry-specific capabilities as out-of-the-box products. This has all been designed and built in complete collaboration with the Salesforce engineering teams.

These out-of-the-box products support our customers’ rapid time-to-market, simplified processes, increased agility and ongoing innovation. All at a lower cost of ownership to the business. However, these business advantages are only gained if the out-of-the-box product is fully leveraged, implemented properly and deployed as designed. This demands a complete and comprehensive understanding of the out-of-the-box product supported by strong program governance and deep enterprise architecture experience.

This is where Salesforce Industries’ Program Architects delivers a critical service. With your unique combination of deep Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, Enterprise Architecture and Industry experience, you have the knowledge and expertise to ensure that our customers are fully leveraging their investment in the platform and taking full advantage of the out-of-the-box functionality.

As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will have 10+ years of industry experience, undergo the most rigorous and comprehensive Salesforce and Salesforce Industries training, collaborate with our engineering teams on a daily basis, and have complete coverage of the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product at every layer.

Salesforce Industries' Program Architects are aware of every element of the industry data model, every business process available in the library, and every component of the omni-channel user experience. This means that when our customers have a business requirement that needs addressing, you understand how to deliver it using the out-of-the-box capabilities and avoid the need for customisation.

As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will not be an additional resource on the project team or compared to a traditional services role. Rather, your role brings a very specific range of strategic, industry, Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, and CRM architecture skills to the table. Your value maps directly to the business value gained through leveraging the Salesforce Industries product 100% with the resulting rapid time-to-market, simplified processes, increased agility and ongoing innovation. Not to mention the cost avoidance of customization, deployment delays, errors with mission critical systems, and the inability to take advantage of ongoing innovation and upgrades.

From our experience, the overall success of any digital transformation program, which is often a significant investment, is directly tied to the strategic involvement of a Salesforce Industries Program Architect from the start.

We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.
Projects we have worked on include:Covid-19 Vaccination National Appointment System - A suite of systems built to enable Singapore's national vaccination campaign for Covid-19. This includes informational sites, appointment booking systems, and records management systems.Data.gov.sg - An open repository of all the Singapore Government's public data.

What does a Software Engineer do?As a software engineer, you will:Build prototypes to demonstrate technological opportunitiesDesign system architecturesWrite production quality codeManage deployments to cloud infrastructure
Because our team focuses on pushing new initiatives, you will also have to:Identify potential projects that improve the public goodDesign novel systems that work around bureaucratic constraintsAdvocate and explain these technical ideas to other government agencies
We are also looking for experienced software engineers! In addition to the above, more experienced software engineers will be expected to:Establish best practices for developer operations(For more experienced engineers) provide technical leadership across multiple product teamsShare your expertise and mentor other engineersHelp with recruiting
You're not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the development community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. These often include, but are not limited to: GitHub, AWS, React Native, MongoDB, and Stripe amongst others. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. You will have direct ownership of your work with over 70% of our projects starting as ground up initiatives. Rather than work on commercial ventures commonly found in the startup scene, we're here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
What it is like working hereRapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.Ownership - In addition to responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Doing that which you believe in is the best way to do what works best for the team.Continuous Learning - Working on new approaches often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to study industry best practices and learning cross-functional skills (e.g. software engineers learn UX design) is not just encouraged but essential.
Who we are looking forWe work mostly in JavaScript. However, we don’t require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Core competency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.
We look for people who:Have a demonstrated ability to build software - Prior work and personal projects count for much more than specific degrees.Write code to solve abstract programming problems - Clear thinking, the ability to debug, and understanding the limits of an approach matter much more than getting the “correct” answer.Talk and reason about code with other engineers - We work as a team so you need to be able to not just solve problems, but have other people understand your solutions.Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction.Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest.

Infrastructure Intern,3.0,2022-03-01,"Job Description

We are looking for outstanding graduating students to join our Summer Internship program, with the opportunity to convert into a full-time Infrastructure Analyst. Find out more about open roles, and hear from former interns and current analysts: https://www.mlp.com/careers/students/

Our Summer Internship Program is focused on finding inquisitive, and problem solving minds and then training them on a broad range of Infrastructure topics. You will receive instruction from our expert teams and research your own areas of interest. In parallel you will learn the skills required to support our internal customers, and deal with operational issues in our production trading environment.

This training will set you up for a long successful career in the Infrastructure Technology team. You will have the opportunity to shape your career and specialize in any of a wide range of Infrastructure disciplines that you find most interesting.

Job Function Summary

The Infrastructure team is focused on the broken and the breakable. We obsess over how, when and why things fail. We analyze every new application and service, then immediately start theorizing on the many ways it can be broken or impaired! Since no human can stay constantly vigilant, we find or build automated solutions to fix these problems, often writing our own code in Python, or using frameworks like Ansible.

Of all the IT teams, the Infrastructure group probably has the widest responsibilities. We support and engineer solutions for phones, desktop computers, mobile devices, the network, the datacenter, Linux and Windows servers, operating system internals, application performance tuning, underlying storage, etc. The servers are often virtual, and increasingly hosted by cloud providers like AWS and Google.

To be successful in Infra, we need thinkers who are prepared to learn all of these areas to a basic level, before eventually diving deep into a few of them. We need people who can come up with new ideas and solutions to hard problems. We need scientists who can take the time to experiment and defend new approaches. We need people who can think bigger - how do things work in an imperfect world, how can we prepare for unexpected failures?

Principal Responsibilities

The internship program starts with 10 weeks of guided research and learning. This research will encourage collaboration across both technical and geographical team boundaries. You will acquire a rounded view on specialist topics from our internal experts. You will use these initial weeks to learn about the company and the global infrastructure team, and start to build an idea of what an Infrastructure career at Millennium can mean for you!

In parallel, you will be trained as a Desktop Support Engineer. This will provide exposure to dealing with customers and solving timely problems in a production environment. You will learn about supporting our end users, and the difference in needs from developers through to VIP business users. While primarily focused on desktop, you will also learn about datacenter management, telecom/phones, network, AWS, etc.

This mix of research skills, and expertise of practical support will set you up with a great base to then further your Millennium career. You will be encouraged to continue your studies and specialize in your area of choice. Over time, your focus will shift from support to engineering as your subject matter expertise expands, and your career progresses.

Qualifications/Skills Required
Degree or Postgraduate holder with Major in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or similar.Great problem solving and analytic skillsStrong written and verbal communication skillsApplicants must be able to commence full-time employment from Q3 2022 onwardsAble to commit to a 10-week internship from May 2022",False,MILLENNIUM CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (SINGAPORE) PTE.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

"Senior Software Test Engineer, Mobile Development",2.0,2022-03-03,"About Us

We own and develop the Dyson Link Smart home app, which is at the forefront of Dyson's IoT experience. We are proud of what we have built so far; we have an App Store and Google Play rating of 4.5 and 4.3 stars respectively, we have more than 1 million active users worldwide and our IoT platform has over 3 million connected Dyson machines. We have huge ambition to grow this platform and as we connect more machines from more categories the challenge is significant.

Our team 

There are 5 app teams, located in the UK and Singapore, each with up to 6 mobile developers and 3 test automation engineers, plus a scrum master and product owner. We all come from a variety of educational backgrounds and experience levels; not all of us are computer science graduates. We believe that teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds are more successful and innovative.

Our teams have the autonomy to manage their own work using Scrum or Kanban frameworks, each honing their ways of working through regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing. We all share a commitment to creating high-quality code, and engineers choose to follow practices such as pair programming, mobbing, and test-driven development. We also regularly share our knowledge and interests peer-to-peer through ‘community meetings’, which have led to the adoption of new technologies and improved cross-team collaboration.

We often need to interact with people from different parts of the business, such as embedded software and the cloud teams, so we plan in 5-sprint ‘increments’, based on the best bits of the Scaled Agile Framework. This gives us more visibility of upcoming work while remaining responsive, and allows us to collaborate effectively with other teams within our 11,000-person organisation.

Mutual trust and respect between team members is important to build a supportive environment where people can do their best work. Our teams understand themselves well enough to make decisions about how they work; everyone’s contribution is vital.

Besides being software professionals, we are also people who enjoy playing online or board games, heading out to lunchtime yoga classes, recording our latest run on Strava or just catching up over coffee. The last year has been a challenge, but we have maintained and strengthened our culture while working through the various lockdowns with virtual events, an informal team newsletter and an empathetic attitude to the needs of individuals.

Our tech 

Android: We write our unit tests with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito, and our UI tests are written in Kotlin using the Espresso framework with Kakao.

iOS: Unit tests are written with XCTest and RxTest, and we write our automated UI tests in Swift using XCUITest.

We also have a handful of cross platform appium tests written in ruby, but we are migrating away from these in favour of XCUITest and Espresso.

Unit and UI tests are written as part of each story to ensure we maintain an up to date and comprehensive set of automated tests with no test debt. We complement our automated tests with exploratory testing, involving both developers and testers in order to uncover issues quickly.

About The Role

We are on the lookout for Test Engineers to join our mobile app team at Dyson. Communication, collaboration, self-evaluation and a desire to improve are second nature to you, and you value good engineering practises. You understand the need to deliver robust, testable code balanced against the need to deliver fast.
Working with your fellow engineers to contribute to features and improvements to our Dyson Link app, ensuring they are tested, robust and scalableWorking with colleagues from other disciplines, including developers, product owners, Scrum Masters, UX/UI designers, and software engineers in our cloud and embedded teamsSharing knowledge within the app team to develop your skills and competencies and those of your teammatesIdentifying new technologies, tools and approaches to help continually improve standards and qualityWriting UI automation testsCoordinating exploratory testing sessionsMonitoring and prioritising bugsKeeping the scrum team focused on a quality first mindset About you

Benefits

Dyson Singapore monitors the market to ensure competitive salaries and bonuses. Beyond that, you’ll enjoy a transport allowance and comprehensive medical care and insurance. But financial benefits are just the start of a Dyson career. Professional growth, leadership development and new opportunities abound, driven by regular reviews and dynamic workshops. And with a vibrant culture, the latest devices and a relaxed dress code reflecting our engineering spirit, it’s an exciting team environment geared to fuelling and realising ambition.

Dyson is an equal opportunity employer. We know that great minds don’t think alike, and it takes all kinds of minds to make our technology so unique. We welcome applications from all backgrounds and employment decisions are made without regard to race, colour, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or other any other dimension of diversity.

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

Job Function Summary

The Information Security team is for the hackers at heart. Do you find yourself checking /r/netsec before your email in the morning? Do buffer overflows fill you with joy? Does threat intel and incident response get your engine going? Do you find yourself doing something twice, and wondering, “How do I automate this so I never have to do this again?” If so, you might be a good fit for Millennium’s Info Sec team!

We use our powers for good, not evil, to enable the business to securely operate. We work vigilantly to protect our users and our assets from the perils of the evil Internet. When we see a new application or feature, we immediately wonder in what ways it can be broken or contorted to do our evil bidding, trying to find the bugs before the bad guys do!

Our security team covers an expansive problem space encompassing virtually every aspect of the business. Systems of all make and manner, cloud-based and on-prem, workstations and VMs alike! AWS? Yep. Google Cloud? Uh-huh. Kubernetes? Yah, there’s some of that, too! We identify with identity management, we think it’s great to federate. We operate firewalls at all layers of the OSI models. We like to log and audit stuff - a lot. We scan all the things!

To be successful in Information Security, we need thinkers with an intense desire to understand all aspects of cybersecurity as it pertains to both our tech stack as well as our business model. We need people who hate repetition and want to develop solutions that free us from mundane tasks. We need engineers who can take the time to experiment and defend new approaches.

About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for Web3 developers. Infura currently supports Ethereum and IPFS APIs, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a decentralized future powered by Web3, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the team: we are a remote-first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

Have you ever thought, “I wish more developers knew how to build on Web3 and I want to help guide them”? If so, you are absolutely who we are looking for. If not, don’t worry, anyone who has experience creating technical content, is looking for an exciting new technology and an opportunity to grow should apply! This role is an opportunity to learn and improve, as part of a talented team, with plenty of challenges in a rapidly developing technology.
