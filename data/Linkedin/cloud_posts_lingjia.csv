Find out more about open roles, and hear from former interns and current analysts: https://www.mlp.com/careers/students/

The talent and dedication of our people are critical to our success. Our internship opportunity will expose you to a broad range of disciplines as you receive subject-matter training from the industry’s leading professionals. If you are ambitious, results-driven, and ready to take on new challenges, we want to talk.

Job Function Summary

The Information Security team is for the hackers at heart. Do you find yourself checking /r/netsec before your email in the morning? Do buffer overflows fill you with joy? Does threat intel and incident response get your engine going? Do you find yourself doing something twice, and wondering, “How do I automate this so I never have to do this again?” If so, you might be a good fit for Millennium’s Info Sec team!

We use our powers for good, not evil, to enable the business to securely operate. We work vigilantly to protect our users and our assets from the perils of the evil Internet. When we see a new application or feature, we immediately wonder in what ways it can be broken or contorted to do our evil bidding, trying to find the bugs before the bad guys do!

Our security team covers an expansive problem space encompassing virtually every aspect of the business. Systems of all make and manner, cloud-based and on-prem, workstations and VMs alike! AWS? Yep. Google Cloud? Uh-huh. Kubernetes? Yah, there’s some of that, too! We identify with identity management, we think it’s great to federate. We operate firewalls at all layers of the OSI models. We like to log and audit stuff - a lot. We scan all the things!

To be successful in Information Security, we need thinkers with an intense desire to understand all aspects of cybersecurity as it pertains to both our tech stack as well as our business model. We need people who hate repetition and want to develop solutions that free us from mundane tasks. We need engineers who can take the time to experiment and defend new approaches. We need people who can think bigger – who can operate in an imperfect world, who likes to break things, but more importantly who like to put them back together just a little better than they found them.

Principal Responsibilities

Junior engineers on Millennium’s Information Security team start their journey with our awesome Security Operations team.You will work as part of the SecOps team to respond to and triage common security events. You will work with other teams across technology and our partners in other parts of our business to resolve issues before they get out of hand.You will learn how to identify when to true security concerns, and work with appropriate teams around the globe to resolve problems. While you must be able to work independently as needed, the ability to interface with and work collaboratively with others is even more critical!

As you hone your security spider senses, you will be mentored in a wide range of technologies and explore other areas of security engineering.You’ll have the chance to seek advanced training in any topics of interest you discover as you gain invaluable experience in the lucrative field of information security.As your career at Millennium progresses, opportunities will arise to specialize in your newfound areas of expertise.

Beneficial Skills (We train from scratch, but these skills would help) 
Project management, ownership of problems, and a track record of strong attention to detail.A solid foundation in network fundamentals with regards to TCP/IP and the OSI model.Strong familiarity with Windows and/or Linux, ideally with familiarity of a command line shell like BASH or PowerShell.Knowledge of a programming language - ideally Python, Ruby or Golang.Understanding of vulnerabilities, common security flaws, and an insatiable desire to squash them!

Worldwide, more than 75 million young people are unemployed. But many employers can’t find people with the skills they need for entry-level jobs. Generation was created in 2014 to help bridge this gap—at speed and scale.

We’re building a skills-training methodology that can serve hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of young people a year. And we’re building proof that this training creates real business outcomes for employers, and lasting career impact for trainees—so everyone has the incentive to invest in skills. Our goal is to help our students achieve personal and professional success—and fundamentally change their life trajectories. Generation programs prepare unemployed or underemployed young people, aged 18 to 29, for jobs in four sectors: healthcare, technology, retail/sales, and skilled trades.

 Job Category Customer Success Group Job Details 

The Enterprise Architect (also known as Program Architect) is an instrumental service at Salesforce Industries, partnering with our leading customers to fully maximise their investment in the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product and implement the platform as it was designed. This ensures our customers deploy a solution that is fast to market, highly performant and scalable, and allows them to realize the overall business objectives of their digital transformation program.

Built In Partnership With Salesforce, It Is 100% Native And Additive To The Salesforce Platform With 3 Fundamental Layers

Salesforce Industries serves the world’s largest companies with the most complete and innovative suite of industry-focused, customer-centric & omni-channel solutions.
 An extensive industry-specific data model.  A complete set of industry-specific business processes and integrations.  A full range of industry-specific omni-channel experiences and apps (including sales, marketing, service, enterprise product catalog, CPQ, contract management, order management and commerce solutions). 
Salesforce Industries has invested over $100m in R&D to extend Salesforce and deliver these industry-specific capabilities as out-of-the-box products. This has all been designed and built in complete collaboration with the Salesforce engineering teams.

These out-of-the-box products support our customers’ rapid time-to-market, simplified processes, increased agility and ongoing innovation. All at a lower cost of ownership to the business. However, these business advantages are only gained if the out-of-the-box product is fully leveraged, implemented properly and deployed as designed. This demands a complete and comprehensive understanding of the out-of-the-box product supported by strong program governance and deep enterprise architecture experience.

This is where Salesforce Industries’ Program Architects delivers a critical service. With your unique combination of deep Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, Enterprise Architecture and Industry experience, you have the knowledge and expertise to ensure that our customers are fully leveraging their investment in the platform and taking full advantage of the out-of-the-box functionality.

As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will have 10+ years of industry experience, undergo the most rigorous and comprehensive Salesforce and Salesforce Industries training, collaborate with our engineering teams on a daily basis, and have complete coverage of the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product at every layer.

Salesforce Industries' Program Architects are aware of every element of the industry data model, every business process available in the library, and every component of the omni-channel user experience. This means that when our customers have a business requirement that needs addressing, you understand how to deliver it using the out-of-the-box capabilities and avoid the need for customisation.

As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will not be an additional resource on the project team or compared to a traditional services role. Rather, your role brings a very specific range of strategic, industry, Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, and CRM architecture skills to the table.
