"Senior Software Test Engineer, Mobile Development","Singapore, Singapore",2,19,,2022-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,false,https://careers.dyson.com/en-gb/job-description/senior-software-test-engineer-mobile-development/JR2357?source=Linkedin,"About Us

We own and develop the Dyson Link Smart home app, which is at the forefront of Dyson's IoT experience. We are proud of what we have built so far; we have an App Store and Google Play rating of 4.5 and 4.3 stars respectively, we have more than 1 million active users worldwide and our IoT platform has over 3 million connected Dyson machines. We have huge ambition to grow this platform and as we connect more machines from more categories the challenge is significant.

Our team 

There are 5 app teams, located in the UK and Singapore, each with up to 6 mobile developers and 3 test automation engineers, plus a scrum master and product owner. We all come from a variety of educational backgrounds and experience levels; not all of us are computer science graduates. We believe that teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds are more successful and innovative.

Our teams have the autonomy to manage their own work using Scrum or Kanban frameworks, each honing their ways of working through regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing. We all share a commitment to creating high-quality code, and engineers choose to follow practices such as pair programming, mobbing, and test-driven development. We also regularly share our knowledge and interests peer-to-peer through ‘community meetings’, which have led to the adoption of new technologies and improved cross-team collaboration.

We often need to interact with people from different parts of the business, such as embedded software and the cloud teams, so we plan in 5-sprint ‘increments’, based on the best bits of the Scaled Agile Framework. This gives us more visibility of upcoming work while remaining responsive, and allows us to collaborate effectively with other teams within our 11,000-person organisation.

Mutual trust and respect between team members is important to build a supportive environment where people can do their best work. Our teams understand themselves well enough to make decisions about how they work; everyone’s contribution is vital.

Besides being software professionals, we are also people who enjoy playing online or board games, heading out to lunchtime yoga classes, recording our latest run on Strava or just catching up over coffee. The last year has been a challenge, but we have maintained and strengthened our culture while working through the various lockdowns with virtual events, an informal team newsletter and an empathetic attitude to the needs of individuals.

Our tech 

Android: We write our unit tests with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito, and our UI tests are written in Kotlin using the Espresso framework with Kakao.

iOS: Unit tests are written with XCTest and RxTest, and we write our automated UI tests in Swift using XCUITest.

We also have a handful of cross platform appium tests written in ruby, but we are migrating away from these in favour of XCUITest and Espresso.

Unit and UI tests are written as part of each story to ensure we maintain an up to date and comprehensive set of automated tests with no test debt. We complement our automated tests with exploratory testing, involving both developers and testers in order to uncover issues quickly.

About The Role

We are on the lookout for Test Engineers to join our mobile app team at Dyson. Communication, collaboration, self-evaluation and a desire to improve are second nature to you, and you value good engineering practises.

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who We Are

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

 What you will be working on: 

You will work on both small and large scale projects, building and maintaining the infrastructure behind them. We are fully aligned with the Government’s cloud-first policy and you will bring capability to help us realize this. The role includes:
Managing the development, deployment, orchestration and maintenance of data pipelines for our Data Science productsProviding DevOps architecture implementation and operational supportArchitecture and planning for cloud deployments (Private and Public cloud)Developing and managing processes, automation, best practices, documentationDevelopment and operation of continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

What It Is Like Working Here

We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

As we often deal with big data and computing requirements, you are also able to take a long-term strategic view of the platforms you work on, and help provide this perspective to the team. To do so, you will:
Effectively prioritize and execute tasks in a high-pressure environmentDevelop and maintain internal engineering productivity tools and environmentsPerform independent research into product and environment issues as requiredMonitoring automation to effectively detect/predict/prevent issues in the environment and code baseFuture-proofing the technical environments and ensuring extreme high levels of automation, availability, scalability and resilienceHands-on coding and mentoring, working in highly collaborative teams and building quality environmentsHave knowledge in and/or continuously learn lots of different open source technologies and configurations

 What we are looking for: 

The customers for our products are normally agency users, which means that breadth of knowledge in government IT infrastructure and experience in government networks will help. Since our direction is cloud-first, you will likely have some experience in patch/update scheduling, and knowledge of security incident response procedures. A disciplined approach and strong problem-solving instincts are fundamental to succeed. Your aptitude for completing the tasks and attitude to continuous learning are more valued than any formal certification. To succeed, you will need to possess some of the following:
Excellent problem solving and methodical troubleshooting skillsStrong knowledge and experience in DevOps automation, containerization and orchestration using tools eg. Ansible, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Artifactory/Nexus SonatypeCloud computing deployment and management experience in AWS, GCPStrong scripting skills e.g. Python, Bash, JavaScript, Scala, Rust, GoStrong understanding of Apache Spark/Flink, Hadoop, distributed file systems and resource scaling/scheduling, streaming message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)Strong understanding of virtualization and networking conceptsExperience with patch maintenance, regression testing and security incident responseExperience with interactive workloads, machine learning toolkits and how they integrate with cloud computing e.g. Databricks, KXExperience with highly scalable distributed systemsExperience with on-premise deployments, government application and networking infrastructure/routingBreadth of knowledge - OS, networking, distributed computing, cloud computing

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company as we believe that diversity is meaningful to innovation. Our employee benefits are based on a total rewards approach, offering a comprehensive and market-competitive suite of perks. This includes generous leave benefits to meet your work-life needs.

We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.
Projects we have worked on include:Covid-19 Vaccination National Appointment System - A suite of systems built to enable Singapore's national vaccination campaign for Covid-19.

What does a Software Engineer do?As a software engineer, you will:Build prototypes to demonstrate technological opportunitiesDesign system architecturesWrite production quality codeManage deployments to cloud infrastructure
Because our team focuses on pushing new initiatives, you will also have to:Identify potential projects that improve the public goodDesign novel systems that work around bureaucratic constraintsAdvocate and explain these technical ideas to other government agencies
We are also looking for experienced software engineers! In addition to the above, more experienced software engineers will be expected to:Establish best practices for developer operations(For more experienced engineers) provide technical leadership across multiple product teamsShare your expertise and mentor other engineersHelp with recruiting
You're not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the development community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. These often include, but are not limited to: GitHub, AWS, React Native, MongoDB, and Stripe amongst others. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. You will have direct ownership of your work with over 70% of our projects starting as ground up initiatives. Rather than work on commercial ventures commonly found in the startup scene, we're here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
What it is like working hereRapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.Ownership - In addition to responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Doing that which you believe in is the best way to do what works best for the team.Continuous Learning - Working on new approaches often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to study industry best practices and learning cross-functional skills (e.g. software engineers learn UX design) is not just encouraged but essential.
Who we are looking forWe work mostly in JavaScript. However, we don’t require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Core competency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.
We look for people who:Have a demonstrated ability to build software - Prior work and personal projects count for much more than specific degrees.Write code to solve abstract programming problems - Clear thinking, the ability to debug, and understanding the limits of an approach matter much more than getting the “correct” answer.Talk and reason about code with other engineers - We work as a team so you need to be able to not just solve problems, but have other people understand your solutions.Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction.Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest.
Overall we look for people who have ability, initiative, good communication, and strong values.",false,"Open Government Products, GovTech Singapore",https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-government-products,,Engineering,Computer Software,2022-03-23T12:24:34.000Z,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2923856936/,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFEo4NE5d81jQ/company-logo_200_200/0/1542685551960?e=1655337600&v=beta&t=ssSCs-C-2E60IVkUD8Pl2YGsMTEujN9rxDwGYCAHUXI,2022-03-14T20:09:26.003Z,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2923856936/,
