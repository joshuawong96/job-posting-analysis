Job Purpose

Digital Data Analysis Improvement Project

Key Activities

Modern manufacturing is no longer just about finding ways to operate faster while reducing expenses; it is also about doing so in a data-driven and intelligent way. With technologies such as cloud and data analytics, the vast quantities of data generated can be processed and translated into actionable insights to diagnose problems and identify opportunities for improvement. With machine learning, highly intelligent systems can assist the workforce in optimising processes, predicting equipment failures and changes in demand patterns. At their best, these intelligent systems can also autonomously make decisions and respond to changing internal and external business needs.

An opportunity exists to enhance performance monitoring through development of interactive digital dashboards to trend key performance indicators (KPIs). Performance dashboards are used extensively during Tier review meetings; data displayed focuses on high level KPI’s for Tier 4 meetings, with associated drill-down data relevant to specific functions required at the lower level Tiers. It is therefore critical that dashboards offer a high level of connectivity and adaptability to enable their use across the tier meeting requirements.

The site goals are to “Improve the yield efficiency campaign over campaign”, to “improve cost of goods”, and to “make GSK a great place to work”.

As we drive in this direction and to assist the site achieve these goals, Data Platform and Data Intelligent Services platform were built by the IT and Advanced Manufacturing Technologies teams.

We are looking for outstanding graduating students to join our Summer Internship program, with the opportunity to convert into a full-time Infrastructure Analyst. Find out more about open roles, and hear from former interns and current analysts: https://www.mlp.com/careers/students/

Our Summer Internship Program is focused on finding inquisitive, and problem solving minds and then training them on a broad range of Infrastructure topics. You will receive instruction from our expert teams and research your own areas of interest. In parallel you will learn the skills required to support our internal customers, and deal with operational issues in our production trading environment.

This training will set you up for a long successful career in the Infrastructure Technology team. You will have the opportunity to shape your career and specialize in any of a wide range of Infrastructure disciplines that you find most interesting.

Job Function Summary

The Infrastructure team is focused on the broken and the breakable. We obsess over how, when and why things fail. We analyze every new application and service, then immediately start theorizing on the many ways it can be broken or impaired! Since no human can stay constantly vigilant, we find or build automated solutions to fix these problems, often writing our own code in Python, or using frameworks like Ansible.

Of all the IT teams, the Infrastructure group probably has the widest responsibilities. We support and engineer solutions for phones, desktop computers, mobile devices, the network, the datacenter, Linux and Windows servers, operating system internals, application performance tuning, underlying storage, etc. The servers are often virtual, and increasingly hosted by cloud providers like AWS and Google.

To be successful in Infra, we need thinkers who are prepared to learn all of these areas to a basic level, before eventually diving deep into a few of them. We need people who can come up with new ideas and solutions to hard problems. We need scientists who can take the time to experiment and defend new approaches. We need people who can think bigger - how do things work in an imperfect world, how can we prepare for unexpected failures?

Principal Responsibilities

The internship program starts with 10 weeks of guided research and learning. This research will encourage collaboration across both technical and geographical team boundaries. You will acquire a rounded view on specialist topics from our internal experts. You will use these initial weeks to learn about the company and the global infrastructure team, and start to build an idea of what an Infrastructure career at Millennium can mean for you!

In parallel, you will be trained as a Desktop Support Engineer. This will provide exposure to dealing with customers and solving timely problems in a production environment. You will learn about supporting our end users, and the difference in needs from developers through to VIP business users. While primarily focused on desktop, you will also learn about datacenter management, telecom/phones, network, AWS, etc.

This mix of research skills, and expertise of practical support will set you up with a great base to then further your Millennium career. You will be encouraged to continue your studies and specialize in your area of choice. Over time, your focus will shift from support to engineering as your subject matter expertise expands, and your career progresses.

Job Description

Your Career

As a member of the sales leadership team, you will build, grow and develop a high performing team of cloud security sales professionals. Reporting to the regional VP of Prisma Cloud sales, you'll be charged with all aspects of growing the Prisma Cloud business. This requires an ability to leverage your knowledge of the market, develop and execute a strategy for your region, and partner with cross-functional teams such as product marketing and sales operations. This is not your typical sales leadership role; Prisma Cloud operates as a startup within a larger company, and you'll be joining a critical moment in our growth journey.

Palo Alto Networks has brought technology to the market that is reshaping the public cloud security industry. Our ability to secure the cloud is limited only by our ability to establish relationships with partners and potential customers and help them understand how our products can protect their cloud environments. This is where our sales teams come in; they work together with large organizations to keep their employees, data and operations secure. Our passionate sales teams educate, inspire, and empower their clients and partners to out pace cyber threats.

As part of our sales team, you are empowered with unmatched systems and tools, constantly updated research and sales libraries, and a team built on joint success.
