About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for Web3 developers. Infura currently supports Ethereum and IPFS APIs, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a decentralized future powered by Web3, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the team: we are a remote-first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

What You’ll Do

As a Technical Writer at ConsenSys you'll create technical documentation that will help developers understand and use our tools. Have you ever thought, “I wish more developers knew how to build on Web3 and I want to help guide them”? If so, you are absolutely who we are looking for. If not, don’t worry, anyone who has experience creating technical content, is looking for an exciting new technology and an opportunity to grow should apply! This role is an opportunity to learn and improve, as part of a talented team, with plenty of challenges in a rapidly developing technology.

Would be great if you brought this to the role 
Established portfolio of developer content. Worked for or contributed to a company that provides tools for developers. A knowledge of or passion to learn about the new Web3 technology space. Technologist by experience or education. Comfortable operating in an Agile environment and dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity

Don't check all of the boxes? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?
